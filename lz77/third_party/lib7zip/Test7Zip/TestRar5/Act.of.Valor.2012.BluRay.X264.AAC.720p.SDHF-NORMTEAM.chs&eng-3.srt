about those boxy abstract paintings.

that Christo is worth

76
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,799
- 有近10亿美元了
- 10亿？
- close to a billion.
- That's with a "B"?

77

医疗诊所，学校，政治献金
with medical clinics,
schools, political donations,

79
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,578
什么都有，所以情况是：
you name it, so this is the deal:

80
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,578
他们在这儿都对他相当忠诚
They are extremely
loyal to him over here.

81
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,183
药品管理局什么时候才把他交给我们？
When did the DEA hand him over to us?

82
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,947
等他们拦截到装载苏制武器的波音707吧
When they intercepted a 707 of his

83

intercepts connecting Christo

85
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,029

to a jihadist network
out of Southeast Asia.

86
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,257
显然，克里斯多和其中一人控制组织
Apparently, Christo and one
of the guys running the network,

87
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,833
他们是从小就相识

flying a B-24 in World War ll.

90
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,038
他一直控制着“解放者”以使其他人安全跳伞
（B-24代号）
He kept the Liberator aloft
just long enough for everyone to jump,

91
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,444
最后同飞机一起坠毁牺牲了
and then he went down
with the plane.

92
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,643
这就是你血管里淌着的血
That's the blood
that courses in your veins.

93
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,948
- 爸爸，我能跟你一起去吗？
- 你要一起去？
- Daddy, can I come with you?
- You want to come with me?

94

Did you feel how cold it is out there?
I'll tell you what,

去跟你妈妈一起照看小宝宝，
go hang out with Mommy for a little while,
help out with the baby.

96
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,697
等我回来如果你还想去，我就带你一起
When I come back in, if you still want
to go out, I'll take you out with me.

我知道你在纽约玩过
Now, I know you got
the New York heritage,

101
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,312
不过这可不像躺在斯坦顿岛那样简单
but this isn't exactly like
sitting back in Staten Island.

102
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,417
你得努力才能冲过浪花
You got to actually work hard
to get through the surf.

104
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,380
还不知道怎么冲浪？
and you don't know
how to do this?

105

你准备好喝海水了吗？
You ready to get
in the drink or what?

108
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,656
好了，伙计，开路吧
All right, man, lead the way.

DA VE: Your father was my Boss,
and I was his Chief

相互熟知让我们关系紧密
What we knew about each other
strengthened our bond as operators.

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,200
我们情如兄弟
There was a brotherhood between us,

113
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,139
比家人之间还要相互依赖
and we depended on each other
more than a family.

114
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,780
图康萨说，“兄弟同心”
Tecumseh said,
"Although a single twig will break,

我还是不敢相信你在这地方点中餐
I still can't believe you
ordered Chinese in this place.

122
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:11,720
- “白痴”？
- 伤心了吧，甜心
- "Dumb"?
- Read it and weep, sugar.

123
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,451
我不会伤心的
I'll try not to.

124
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,726
看看，看看，我得了38分
Look at this, look at this.
Thirty-eight points for me.

125
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,992
“adumbrating”？这不是单词啊
"Adumbrating,"
that's not even a word.

126
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,295
好吧，首先，它读作“adumbrating”
OK, first of all,
it's pronounced "adumbrating,"

127
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,099
而且意思是“假装，预示”
and it means pretending,
foreshadowing.

128
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,237
嗯...
Hm...

129
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,742
猜猜今晚该谁买单，甜心？
Guess who's buying dinner
tonight, sugar.

130
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,743
好吧
Fine.

世上总少不了这种耍小聪明搭档
In most cases,
officers get tactical partners.

中情局给我派了个拼字作弊的
Langley sets me up
with some son of SCRABBLE hustler.

133
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,093
是拼字大师好不好？别搞错了
WOMAN: SCRABBLE Yoda, OK?
Get it right.

134
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,288
- 多少钱？
- 免费的
- How much do I owe you?
- Nada.

135
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,801
糟糕
Shit.

136
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,578
队里的兄弟们都曾出生入死
DA VE .' Our platoon
was headed downrange.

这家伙都不愿做俯卧撑
This guy didn't even do push-ups

149
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,940
因为他担心胸肌会太大

take a knife into a gunfight

在家最后一晚
That last night at home,

have been a better dad,

166

好丈夫

00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:04,058
想着你本该读的睡前故事或遗忘的周年纪念日
That bedtime story you should have read
or that anniversary you forgot.

168

你不期望家人理解你所做的

to understand what you're doing,

169

只期望他们能接受一切

170
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,968
当你回到家时，能重拾旧日温馨
When you get home, you hope you
can pick up right where you left off

171
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,605
怎么了？
What up?

172
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,901
- 你神经放松了吗？
- 是的，是的
- You putting the wild bunch down?
- Yeah, yeah.

173
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:22,637
嘿，军士，介意我们说几分钟吗，伙计？
Hey, Senior, you mind giving
us a couple minutes, man?

174

嘿，伙计们，你们知道我只在
Hey, fellas, you know
I only got so many speeches

176
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,914
特殊时刻或行动前才要说两句的，不过，额...
in a given work-up or deployment, but, uh...

177
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:35,786
...不过正如小队成立时军士和我曾说的
...it's like Chief and I said right
at the beginning of this platoon:

178
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,521
一旦我们出征，一旦直升机准备载我们前往作战区域
Once we step off on campaign, once this
bird's ready and we're downrange,

179
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,995
后方一切都要安稳
everything back home
needs to be in balance.

180
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,861
如果我们到了那儿却因后方误事
We 're not gonna be worth a damn
to each other or ourselves

181
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,696
那就既对不起自己，也对不起队友了
if we get over there
and something 's out of whack.

182
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,701
我是说，如果家庭有问题
I mean, if things
aren't right with the family,

183
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,670
经济有问题或是其他什么事情
things aren't right with the finances
or something's off;

184
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,073
都会让我们不安稳，所以出发前就得安顿好一切
it's gonna put us all out of balance, so we
need to have that tight before we launch.

185
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,075
如果谁有问题，现在就提
If somebody's got an issue,
bring it up.

186
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,306
军士能帮，我能帮，大家互相都能帮忙
Chief can take care of it, I can take care
of it. Everybody's got each other's back.

187
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,111
要确保无任何杂念，这样行动前
Let's make sure we lock that down
so when we 're ready to roll,

188
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,278
我们就能全身心投入任务
all our focus is on the mission.

189
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,655
敬所有曾参与战斗的勇士
DA VE .' For all those
who have been downrange,

190

00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,295
- 干杯

我还是喜欢詹姆士这个名字
I still like the name James.

193
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,006
我会考虑的，如果是男孩的话
I'll think about it,
if it's a boy.

194
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,370
过来

you keep Mama away from Aunt Carol.

197

我可不喜欢烟味
I don't like that
chain-smoking at all.

198
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,768
我知道了，上尉
I got it, Lieutenant.

199
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,336
- 好吧
- 别担心
- OK.

尽量保持好这发型，好吗？
Try to Keep this as long
as you can for a while, yeah?

202
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,014
还有别的吗，“长官”？
Anything else, Commander?

203
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:12,121
我希望第一个孩子出生时你能在场
Yeah. I'd like to be able to look into
your eyes when our first child is born.

204
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,349
你知道我会尽力的
You know I'll do my best.

205
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,231
我爱你，宝贝
I love you, baby.

206
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,565
我也爱你
Love you.

207
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,204
战争是国家意志的体现
DA VE.' War is a country of will.

208
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,541
容不得半点同情心
There 's no room for sympathy.

209
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:43,380
如果不愿抛弃一切，你就已经输了
If you're not willing to give up everything,
you've already lost.

210
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,056
我们抓到她了，不过她干掉了吉伯特

211
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:01,335
她在这里，老板

212
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,638

告诉我，你们美国人他妈的凭什么
MAN: Tell me, what is it
about you Americans that makes

215
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:18,078
以为有权砸我“饭碗”

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,500
你想怎么样？我已经说了我什么都不知道

219
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,637
我知道你是谁，莫拉里斯小姐，我知道你给谁做事
I know who you are, Miss Morales,
and I know who you work for.

220
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,137
所以何不节约大家时间
So why don't you
save us both some time

221
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,640
告诉我你所知道的？
and tell me exactly
what you think you know?

222
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,682

感觉如何，莫拉里斯小姐？
CHRIS TO: How did that feel,

望您能对“服务”满意
Have a great day at the spa.

225
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,798
关掉手机免提

226
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,108
别把她弄死了，等她开口了打给我

227
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,511
好的，老板
MAN ON PHONE.' Si, jefe.

228

- 嘿，伙计们，怎么样？
- 嘿
- Hey, fellas, what's up?
- Hey.

231
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,770
比两只闷死在羊毛袜的老鼠感觉还热吧？
It's hotter than two rats screwing
in a wool sock out there, yeah?

232
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,000
跟非洲一样...人猿泰山都受不了
Africa-hot...
Tarzan couldn't take this heat.

233
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,008
不管怎样，事情是这样的，你们该上场了
Anyway, here's the deal.
Time to get your frogman on.

234
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,409
熄灯，三天前
Lights. Three days ago,

两名中情局特工，沃尔特・罗斯和丽萨・莫拉里斯
two CIA agents, a Walter Ross
and a Miss Lisa Morales,

236
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:56,584
在哥斯达黎加的旅馆住所内遭遇
were ambushed inside their
hotel room here in Costa Rica

237
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,881
不明武装分子袭击
by a unknown amount
of heavily armed assholes.

238
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:02,924
不幸的是罗斯被杀而莫拉里斯被抓了
Unfortunately, Mr. Ross was murdered,
and Miss Morales has been abducted.

239
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,119
我们相信这是一个叫
We believe that this has been the work

240
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,855
米哈伊尔・特意科维奇的人干的，又名克里斯多
of a guy named Mikhail Troykavitch,
aka Christo.

241
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,966
上尉会给你们他的资料
LT's going to give you
the skinny on him.

242

谢谢，军士，米哈伊尔・特意科维奇，又名克里斯多
Thanks, Senior.
Mikhail Troykavitch, aka Christo.

243
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,873
情报显示这家伙自90年代后期起就一直在
This guy is believed to have been
working cocaine-for-weapons deals

244
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,567
俄罗斯黑手党，哥伦比亚游击队（FARC）和墨西哥毒贩之间
between the Russian mafia, the FARC
guerrillas, and the Mexican drug cartels

245
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,541
做可卡因换武器的生意
ever since the late 1990s.

246
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:26,205
在她被抓前，莫拉里斯正在寻找克里斯多
Now, before she was captured,
Morales was working a possible link

247
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:30,114
和这个家伙――阿布・谢布尔之间的联系
between our boy Christo
and this guy Abu Shabal.

248
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,551
万物之主阿拉万岁
Glory to Allah,
Lord of the worlds,

249
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,315
他创造了我们穆斯林
who has created us as Muslims

250
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,654
引领我们进行圣战
and delivered us with the jihad
on his direct path.

251
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:42,322
遵循真主旨意直至审判日者才能得到和平
Peace be upon those who follow his
direct path till the Day of Judgment.

252
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,230
我要告诉你们美国人
Let me explain this to you Americans.

253
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,097
我们不是分裂分子
We are not separatists.

254
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,240
我们车臣不属于任何国家
We Chechens are not
a legal part of anyone,

255
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:54,935
但是你们美国人通过强制推行政策
but you Americans are willingly
or unwillingly assisting

256
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,810
和侵占所有穆斯林国家
in the genocide of our people
by demanding that we obey certain rules,

257
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:04,421
一直在有意或无意地帮助屠杀我们族人
and by your continued
occupation of all Muslim countries.

258
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:08,353
以万能，神圣的真主之名起誓
With the grace of Allah,
glorious and exalted is he,

259
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:14,362
我们没有安全保障，那美国也不得安宁
America will never be safe
until safety becomes a reality for us.

260
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,659
真主万岁
Allahu Akbar

261
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,927
阿布・谢布尔是车臣恐怖分子
LT: Abu Shabal is
a Chechen terrorist

262
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,435
他和别斯兰学校屠杀事件有关
（2004年9月1日俄罗斯别斯兰人质事件）
who's associated with
the Beslan School Massacre.

263
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,599
他一直活跃于印度尼西亚和菲律宾的训练基地
He's been jumping between training camps
in Indonesia and the Philippines.

264
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:29,268
目前克里斯多和他之间的联系目前还有点不清楚
Now, the connection between Christo
and Abu Shabal is still a little bit fuzzy,

265
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:32,108
不过如果这是莫拉里斯正在查的线索
but if this was the lead
that Morales was working on,

266
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,683
那就很可能是她被绑架的原因，军士？
it could be why
she was abducted. Senior?

267
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,548
好的，这是莫拉里斯的个人资料
All right, this is a personnel
recovery of Miss Morales.

268
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,347
好的，有问题吗？
All right, who's got questions?

269
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,788
军士，你有最新数据吗
Senior Chief, you got
any updated source intel

270
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,622
关于敌营人数的，还有巡逻队呢？
on numbers inside the camp,
and what about roving patrols?

271
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,697
大约8-10个，伙计，但我们对巡逻队一无所知
Maybe eight to ten, bro, but we don't
know anything about roving patrols.

272
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,527
你只能假设他们在那儿
You're just gonna have to assume
that they're out there

273
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,794
布防严密，还是专业人士
walking around, squared away.
They do this for a living, too.

274
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,302
军士，敌方武器装备如何？
Senior, what kind of weapons-on-target
are we looking at?

275
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,566
重武器，这些家伙是毒贩子
Heavy weapons.
These guys are narco-traffickers,

276
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,834
所以他们什么都会有，从苏制DShK大口径机枪
so they can have anything
from Soviet-bloc DShKs.

277
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,740
到美制M2HP12.7毫米重机枪都有可能
They could have M2HP,
.50-cals out there, we don't know.

278
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:06,041
所以如果可以的话，我建议你们带火箭筒
So if there is a weapons' emplacement up
there, I suggest you guys bring rockets.

279
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,743
当然火箭筒威力大，这样就有取胜把握了
Of course, rockets and foliage don't match,
so make sure you got a clear shot.

280
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,148
好的，还有什么？
All right, what else?

281
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,586
她自己能走得动吗？
Any idea whether she's ambulatory or not?

282
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,315
现场都是血迹
There was a ton of blood on the scene,

283
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,892
我们肯定大部分是罗斯的
and a lot of it was Mr. Ross',
we confirmed that.

284
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,088
莫拉里斯的可能也有，不过这些人都是禽兽
Miss Morales may have bled there, too,
but these guys are savages,

285
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,824
所以只能假设她根本走不动了
so you're gonna have to assume
that she is non-ambulatory,

286
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,265
必须带工具把她抬出来
so you're gonna have
to bring stuff to carry her out.

287
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,830
2分钟后跳伞
MAN OVER PA:
Two minutes to drop.

288
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,613
嘿，上尉
Hey, LT.

289
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:50,021
你一定要告诉我们那人是谁，等回来好去揍他一顿
You got to let us know who that guy is,
so when we get back, we can kick his ass.

290
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,059
你说谁呢？
What guy?

291
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,720
给你做这鸟发型的家伙
The guy that gave you
that fucked-up haircut.

292
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,068
- 操
- 该死，桑尼
- Fuck.
- AJAY: Damn, Sonny,

293
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:02,296
还好意思说，你自己不也是“大光头”先生
you should be the last guy to talk.
You look like the Dominican Mr. Clean.

294
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,465
我的头跟你的金牙一样亮，是吧？
SONNY: That means my head
shines like your gold teeth, huh?

295
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,770
别这样说
Don't be like that,

296
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,775
- 很伤自尊的
- 开舱门！
- that's harsh.
- Ramp!

297
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,544
戴上面罩
Mask up.

298
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,817
伙计，告诉你，现在唯一比这要好的事就是做爸爸了
Man, I tell you what. The only thing better
than this right here is being a dad,

299
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,481
换尿布除外，不过...
except for that whole
changing diaper thing, but...

300
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,753
不管怎样桑迪会干的，所以...
...Sandy does that for me anyway, so...

301
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,725
其实我还是挺期待的
I'm actually looking forward to it.

- 麦奇，醒醒
- We're about a click out.
- Mikey, wake up.

408
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:03,888
还有一公里！
One click out!

409
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,900
起来，麦奇，醒醒，加油，兄弟
Let's go, Mike.
Wake up. Come on, buddy.

410
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,511
加油，麦奇！醒醒！
Come on, Mikey! Wake up!

411
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,087
- 好了吗？
- 可以发射
- Good?
- Backstage clear.

412
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:33,925
发射！
Rocket out!

413
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,646
他没呼吸了！
He's not breathing!

414
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,611
- 呼吸，麦奇！
- 我们上来了！我们上来了！
- Breathe, Mikey!
- We're up! We're up!

415
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,111
上士，把你的M4卡宾枪给我！
Chief, let me get your M-4!

416
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,723
长官，撤退船只在哪里？
Sir, what's the status
on those boats?

417
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,588
撤退时跟皮鞭失去联系了
I lost Whiplash on the run.

418
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,663
跟他们说过行动提前了，皮鞭正在火速赶来
Told 'em you hit the target early.
They're coming in hot.

419
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:11,891
- 收到
- 操！撑住，伙计
- Roger that.
- Fuck! Take this, man.

420
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,228
呼吸，麦奇，加油，麦奇
Breathe, Mikey. Come on, Mikey.

421
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,428
- 他没脉搏了
- 后方接敌！
- I got no pulse.
- Contact rear!

422
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,594
后方接敌！
Contact rear!

423
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,839
我靠！
Holy shit!

424
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:20,998
子弹飞进...
Taking rounds in...

425
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:26,245
加速，加速
Pick it up. Pick it up.

426
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,974
艾杰！快反部队在后面！
Ajay! QRF coming up the rear!

427
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:04,210
皮鞭！皮鞭！第二撤退点废了
Whiplash! Whiplash!
Secondary extract is burnt.

428
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,048
正赶往第三撤退点
Moving to tertiary extract.

429
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,157
一共8人，7名队员，一名目标
I have eight packs,
seven Sierras, one package.

430
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,553
目标多处受伤
OVER RADIO: Package
with multiple wounds.

431
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,161
一名队员头部中枪
The Sierra has gunshot wound
to the head.

432
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,388
撤退会很艰难
This will be a hot extract.

433
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,170
什么情况？！
What the fuck?!

434
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:24,897
- 哦，该死！
- 麦奇，趴下！
- Oh, shit!
- Mikey, stay down!

435
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,167
- 按倒他，伙计！
- 我他妈在哪儿？
- Keep him down, man!
- MIKEY: Where the fuck am I?!

436
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:30,073
- 冷静，兄弟
- 麦奇醒了，麦奇醒了
- Calm down, brother.
- Mikey's up, man. Mikey's up.

437
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:33,215
趴下，兄弟，冷静，放松，我们马上就突围出去了
Stay down, brother. Calm.
Be easy. We're almost out of here.

438
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,475
我们马上就突围出去了
We're almost out of here.

439
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,567
麦奇！
Mikey!

440
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,204
- 坚持住，兄弟
- 我们在哪儿？
- Hang on, buddy.
- MIKEY: Where are we?

441
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,067
- 在撤退路上
- 怎么回事？
- We're on our way to extract.
- What happened?

442
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,867
没事了，你脸上中枪，伙计
You're good to go.
You took one to the face, man.

443
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,100
你这个打不死的家伙
You're a hard motherfucker.

444
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,403
- 我们救到她了吗？
- 是的
- Did we get her?
- Yes.

445
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,874
- 哦，天啊
- 我们在撤退路上
- Oh, my God.
- We're on our way to extract.

446
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:06,412
艾杰，冲啊，冲啊
Ajay, splash it. Splash it.

447
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,676
到河边了，到河边了！
Water! Water! Water!

448
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,686
冲河里了！冲河里了！
Going in! Going in!

449
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,715
我抬着她！我抬着她！
I got her! I got her!

450
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,020
车要沉了
It's fucking going under.

451
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,856
出去！他妈的快出去！
Out! Get the fuck out!

452
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,007
我们没白来
ECHOING: It wasn't for nothing.

453
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:06,000
乌克兰

454
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,441
干什么的？

455
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,569
门德尔松的曲子？

456
00:43:52,694 --> 00:43:54,900
不是，勃拉姆斯的

457
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,498
克里莫夫在哪里？

458
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,901
你是谢布尔吧？

459
00:44:03,435 --> 00:44:08,800
就像我在电话里跟克里斯多说的，我这儿有你想要的东西

460
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:15,010
很轻吧？

461
00:44:15,343 --> 00:44:18,800
能穿在燕尾服里

462
00:44:21,149 --> 00:44:25,500
衣服内部装着许多小陶瓷球

463
00:44:25,685 --> 00:44:27,930
多达500个

464
00:44:28,587 --> 00:44:36,200
全部填充进衣服里，内部则装有新型凝胶炸药

465
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,230
这是毁灭性的武器

466
00:44:40,697 --> 00:44:42,300
就是它

467
00:44:47,871 --> 00:44:53,274
我知道它看起来不起眼

468
00:44:54,376 --> 00:44:56,941
这是设计用于开放式环境的

469
00:44:57,643 --> 00:45:01,246
相信我，世上没有比这威力更大的

470
00:45:01,246 --> 00:45:05,000
单人操纵武器了

471
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,580
你看

472
00:45:14,622 --> 00:45:19,400
一切都考虑到了

473
00:45:19,494 --> 00:45:23,397
你可以穿着它自由进出白宫

474
00:45:27,332 --> 00:45:29,233
我能看看演示吗？

475
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:32,570
你有空去西伯利亚吗？

476
00:45:33,536 --> 00:45:35,539
这个玩意爆炸的时候

477
00:45:35,606 --> 00:45:38,608
周围所有人都得死绝

478
00:45:39,107 --> 00:45:42,477
想想有500颗子弹飞向四周

479
00:45:42,577 --> 00:45:45,578
然后全部爆开来

480
00:45:48,015 --> 00:45:52,816
你带着它去球场

481
00:45:52,884 --> 00:45:55,453
或者是赌场，或者是购物商场

482
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:59,690
就会引起美国媒体的极大恐慌

483
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:03,890
接着你就会看到经济崩溃...

484
00:46:15,574 --> 00:46:17,600
伙计，看看你

485
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:20,296
你还是老样子

486
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:24,539
- 需要我为您拿走外衣吗？
- 不用，谢谢

487
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:28,590
知道吗，时不时地
You know, from time to time,

488
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:32,564
我会去看我的老朋友们
I get to see my old friends
from my old life.

489
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:36,427
但总是，总是让人失望
And it's always, always disappointing.

490
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:41,467
有些人成了混蛋，另一些则很无趣
Some become assholes,
other boring,

491
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,636
真不敢相信我以前跟他们交情那么好
and I can't believe I tried to get them
in bed all those years ago.

492
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,782
嘿
Hey.

493
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,182
真高兴你没让我失望，尤里
It is nice not to be disappointed, Yuri.

494
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,050
- 这不是我的名字
- 我知道
- That's not my name.
- I know.

495
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:03,596
默罕默德・阿布・谢布尔，谢布尔之子
Mohammed Abu Shabal,
the son of Shabal

496
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:06,530
拜托，你父亲叫尤基尼
Come on.
Your father's name is Yevgeny.

497
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:08,934
事情会变的
Things change.

498
00:47:09,904 --> 00:47:11,474
是啊，是变了
Yeah, things have changed.

499
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,917
所以相当长时间内这应该是我最后一次见你了
That's why this is the last time we might
have to see each other for quite some time.

500
00:47:16,077 --> 00:47:19,217
因为我得找个地方躲起来
For I might have
to find a hole to hide in.

501
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:23,796
我不明白
I don't understand.

502
00:47:24,953 --> 00:47:28,901
我被中情局盯上了，我不想冒险
I'm being watched by the CIA,
and I'm not taking any chances.

503
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:32,732
只要一有机会，我就举家南下
As soon as the opportunity presents itself,
I'm taking my family south.

504
00:47:32,861 --> 00:47:35,068
我既无能力又无动力和美国人作对
I neither have the energy or the will
to fight the Americans.

505
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,904
我们的生意怎么办，米哈伊尔？
What about our deal, Mikhail?

506
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:40,478
我的人受训将近一年了
My men have been training
for almost a year now.

507
00:47:40,635 --> 00:47:43,616
- 我往里面砸了很多钱
- 合作仍然有效，尤里
- I have devoted much of my resources...
- The deal stands, Yuri.

508
00:47:43,771 --> 00:47:45,944
我提早“退休”不等于
Just because I've taken
early retirement does not mean

509
00:47:46,107 --> 00:47:47,415
我不管生意了
I'm not holding up
my end of the bargain.

510
00:47:47,575 --> 00:47:48,576
要做的事情还有很多
There is so much to be done.

511
00:47:48,743 --> 00:47:51,485
都会继续的，只不过我不参与
And it will be, just without me.

512
00:47:51,646 --> 00:47:53,182
你可以利用我信任的人
You'll have to use
my trusted associates.

513
00:47:53,348 --> 00:47:55,089
这根本不够
That's not so good for me.

514
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,490
- 嘿...
- 嘿！闭嘴！
- Hey...
- Hey! Shut up!

515
00:47:57,352 --> 00:47:58,330
闭嘴！
Shut up!

516
00:47:58,486 --> 00:48:00,864
别再满嘴胡言了！
Stop your fucking bullshit!

517
00:48:01,022 --> 00:48:03,832
这不够，根本没用，你不能说变就变
It's not good. Doesn't work.
You can't change it like that.

518
00:48:03,992 --> 00:48:06,836
- 什么都没变啊，什么都没！
- 你刚跟我说一切都变了
- Nothing changes. Nothing.
- You just told me everything's changed.

519
00:48:07,195 --> 00:48:08,697
这又是怎么回事？这又是怎么回事？
What... What is that?
What is that?

520
00:48:08,863 --> 00:48:10,774
你知道我怎样才走到这一步？
Do you know what I do to get here?!

521
00:48:10,932 --> 00:48:13,378
又牺牲了多少同胞？！
Do you know the men who I've
had to sacrifice to get here?!

522
00:48:13,535 --> 00:48:15,845
你懂不懂啊？！
Do you have any idea?!

523
00:48:16,004 --> 00:48:18,109
根本就不懂，混蛋！你住在象牙塔里，什么都不管
No, you shit! You live up here
in this ivory tower!

524
00:48:18,273 --> 00:48:20,275
你根本...根本不在乎！
You have no... You don't care!

525
00:48:31,653 --> 00:48:37,000
美国黄蜂级两栖攻击舰第6艘“好人理查德”号 中美洲海岸

526
00:48:37,692 --> 00:48:40,263
上士，麦奇伤势怎样？
Hey, Chief, what's the status on Mikey?

527
00:48:40,461 --> 00:48:45,001
眼睛保不住了，不过他能挺过去
He's definitely gonna lose the eye,
but he's... he's hanging tough.

528
00:48:46,701 --> 00:48:48,647
嘿，我得跟传达下表彰
Hey, I'm gonna get right into this.

529
00:48:48,803 --> 00:48:51,306
你们沉重痛击了敌人，救回了莫拉里斯
Great job smoke-checking those
assholes and getting Morales back.

530
00:48:51,472 --> 00:48:54,476
对麦奇来说有点不划算，不过还是得说大家干得好
It's a bum deal for Mikey, but I gotta
tell you what, that was solid work.

531
00:48:54,609 --> 00:48:56,646
上士，你得把这些传达给兄弟们
So, Chief, you make sure you get
that down to the boys right away.

532
00:48:56,811 --> 00:48:57,983
- 听见了么？
- 明白
- You hear me?
- Check.

533
00:48:58,145 --> 00:49:01,922
好的，现在我们谈谈莫拉里斯，她很坚强
All right. Now, Morales,
Morales was one tough chick,

534
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:04,427
但是她让事情变化的很快
but she should've gotten
the stuff up the chain a lot faster

535
00:49:04,585 --> 00:49:06,758
因为事情比我们想象的要复杂的多
because this thing is way
bigger than we thought it was.

536
00:49:06,921 --> 00:49:10,198
怎么会?我以为这只是普通的美国人质营救行动
How is that? I thought this was
a cut-and-dry AMCIT recovery.

537
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:13,771
是的，但是你们在那个地方找到的手机改变了一切
Yeah, it was until we got into that phone
that you guys picked up in that shithole.

538
00:49:13,928 --> 00:49:16,568
这让我觉得事情很不对劲
It turned me on to something
that just does not look right at all.

539
00:49:16,731 --> 00:49:19,678
- 哪里不对了？
- 克里斯多和谢布尔远比我们想象的要“亲密”的多
- And what's not right about it?
- Christo and Shabal are a lot closer

540
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:22,508
谢布尔是个不安定因素
than I thought they were,
and Shabal is a wild card, man.

541
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:26,379
他是个死板的圣战分子， 对金钱和毒品一点儿也不在乎
He is an old-school jihadi that couldn't
give a rat's ass about money or drugs.

542
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,679
是啊，那他的老朋友克里斯多，那个毒贩子呢？
Yeah, and his childhood friend,
Christo, the dope dealer?

543
00:49:28,843 --> 00:49:32,222
伙计，他是在搞走私，不是搞贩毒
He is not a dealer, man.
He's a smuggler.

544
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,691
- 你一定在开玩笑
- 这就是我现在想的
- You have got to be kidding me.
- That is exactly what I'm thinking.

545
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,523
谢布尔想杀美国人
Shabal wants to kill Americans.

546
00:49:37,685 --> 00:49:40,825
克里斯多知道怎么把那些混蛋们带进美国
Christo knows how to get
fuckers inside America.

547
00:49:41,022 --> 00:49:43,298
这可是个大麻烦
This could be big trouble
in little China, fellas.

548
00:49:43,457 --> 00:49:44,959
他们要袭击美国本土
They're gonna hit us at home.

549
00:49:46,894 --> 00:49:49,465
我刚跟特种部队和指挥官商量过
I just got done talking to the boss
and the Spec Ops Task Force,

550
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:50,973
这是下一步的计划
and this is what's gonna go down.

551
00:49:51,132 --> 00:49:53,908
让艾杰和雷准备两小时后登上潜艇
I need Ajay and Ray standing by
to launch for an SR in two hours.

552
00:49:54,068 --> 00:49:56,378
他们得乘“船”去非洲
They're gonna get some
frequent flyer miles on the way to Africa.

553
00:49:56,537 --> 00:49:57,914
为什么是非洲？
Why Africa?

554
00:49:58,072 --> 00:50:00,348
根据你们得到的那个手机，我们跟踪到了非洲的一个机场
We pinned an airfield there
with that phone that you got,

555
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:04,580
而且我认为谢布尔可能在那里向西边转移军火
and I think that Shabal is gonna be there
doing a weapons transfer on his way west.

556
00:50:04,745 --> 00:50:07,316
你说的西边指的是什么？墨西哥西部？
When you say "west," what are
we talking about, Mexico west?

557
00:50:07,481 --> 00:50:11,827
嗯，墨西哥西部，这是最坏的情况
Yeah, Mexico west.
That's worst-case scenario.

558
00:50:11,986 --> 00:50:13,932
你们两个和小队的其他成员在这儿待命
You two and the rest of the platoon
are gonna stay here on standby.

559
00:50:14,088 --> 00:50:15,362
如果有什么意外在美国附近发生
You'll be the primary
assault force in case

560
00:50:15,489 --> 00:50:17,332
你们将会是主要的突击力量
something goes down
anywhere near America.

561
00:50:17,491 --> 00:50:19,300
- 明白
- 明白
- Check.
- Check.

562
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,440
他们现身时你会来随时帮忙吗？
You gonna be around for
any questions as they come up?

563
00:50:21,595 --> 00:50:25,907
不行，伙计，克里斯多给我留下了个烂摊子，然后消失了
No, man. Christo... he pulled a Roman
Polanski on my ass and disappeared.

564
00:50:26,033 --> 00:50:27,910
我得和海豹第四分队联系
So I'm gonna link up
with SEAL Team Four,

565
00:50:28,035 --> 00:50:30,276
我们去南太平洋把他抓回来
and we're gonna go hunt his ass
down in the South Pacific.

566
00:50:30,438 --> 00:50:32,918
所以我恐怕抽不开身
So it's straight up Mai Tais
and palm trees for me, baby.

567
00:50:33,074 --> 00:50:34,018
是啊，兄弟，把他抓回来
Yeah, brother. Go get him.

568
00:50:34,175 --> 00:50:35,415
- 你保重
- 放轻松点
- You be cool.
- Take it easy.

569
00:50:35,576 --> 00:50:37,578
祝你做爸爸有好运，上尉
Good luck with that baby, Lieutenant.

570
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,092
- 每个人都知道么？
- 只有重要人物知道
- Does everybody know?
- Only the important people.

571
00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:44,627
对谁来说是重要人物？你？
The important people to who? You?

572
00:50:44,785 --> 00:50:47,425
我想是的
I guess so.

573
00:50:47,555 --> 00:50:50,536
- 我去通知兄弟们
- 等等
- I'm gonna go brief the boys.
- Hey, hold on one second.

574
00:50:52,126 --> 00:50:54,163
嘿，哥们，我以前从来没写过这些东西
Hey, brother, I've never
written one of these before.

575
00:50:55,463 --> 00:50:58,000
我保证我会保护你的
Hey, I'm tracking with you, sir. I am.

576
00:50:58,165 --> 00:50:59,769
不过，老实说
But, to be honest with you,

577
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,177
我曾打算报告头儿让你回家
I was thinking of calling the command
and trying to get you home.

578
00:51:03,337 --> 00:51:08,082
但现在事情变得糟糕了，我想我们需要你
But now that work's picked up so much,
I feel like we really need you here.

579
00:51:09,443 --> 00:51:10,979
你还记得我们上次在安巴尔的行动么？
（伊拉克西部省）
You remember our
last cruise to AI Anbar?

580
00:51:11,145 --> 00:51:12,988
- 嗯
- 当你在执行那个转折性的任务时
- Yeah.
- When you had that final

581
00:51:13,147 --> 00:51:15,559
你说，我不必在到场？
turnover op, and you said
I didn't need to be there?

582
00:51:15,716 --> 00:51:19,186
我当时躺在床上，一心想要回家
I was laying in bed and I realized the only
thing I needed to do now was go home.

583
00:51:19,353 --> 00:51:22,027
但是如果你们的行动失败了
But if something went south on your op,

584
00:51:22,189 --> 00:51:24,328
我会后悔我没有和你们在一起
I would always regret
not being there with you.

585
00:51:24,492 --> 00:51:26,972
我很感谢你一直这么照顾我，戴夫
I appreciate you taking care
of me big-time, Dave,

586
00:51:27,128 --> 00:51:28,801
但是我要跟队友在一起
but I'm working some things
with the brass.

587
00:51:28,963 --> 00:51:32,843
可以的话，等事情暂缓，我会休息两周
If I can, and things slow down,
I'm gonna get two weeks off.

588
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,140
我真心希望一切顺利
Well, I hope it works out
either way. I really do.

589
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:39,512
但如果失败，我会拿着这张纸
But, if it doesn't,
I'm gonna take this piece of paper,

590
00:51:39,673 --> 00:51:41,482
把它做成一架漂亮的纸飞机
and I'm gonna make it
into a nice paper airplane.

591
00:51:41,642 --> 00:51:44,589
走吧
Beat it.

592
00:52:07,001 --> 00:52:09,072

593
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:39,976
出发！出发！

我们需要你们潜入
We need you to get in,
grab the intel

603
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:30,418
并带出情报，有问题么？
and bounce it back to us.
Do you have any questions?

604
00:53:30,584 --> 00:53:33,258
长官，我有问题，我们制定好了会合地点和时间
Sir, I have a question.
We have the rally point and time.

605
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,422
可是如果他们没按计划出现呢？
What if the meeting
doesn't take place as scheduled?

606
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:37,830
你想让我们盯着目标多长时间呢？
How long do you
want us to stay on target?

607
00:53:37,992 --> 00:53:41,769
这个已经考虑了，所以我计划让你们多呆一会
Now, this one counts, so I'd plan
on being out there for a while.

608
00:53:41,929 --> 00:53:44,102

609
00:53:44,265 --> 00:53:45,437

Hey, Ray, we got two birds

624
00:56:36,036 --> 00:56:37,640
是啊，怎么了？

要是掉了一个，我们都得死

632
00:57:02,564 --> 00:57:04,440
你要换乘不同的飞机

然后穿越两条不同的边境线

634

不，看起来我们可以去袭击目标了
No, looks like we're gonna

gonna do anything crazy, are you?

01:02:01,662 --> 01:02:03,471
特拉斯科维奇？
Troskawicz?

689
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:05,610
还要跟你混多久才能
So how long am I gonna need
to keep busting your balls

690
01:02:05,766 --> 01:02:07,871
得到一块这种补丁？
about getting one of those patches?

691
01:02:08,035 --> 01:02:10,311
啊，我想不会再有了
Ah, yeah, I think it was,
like, a one-time deal, man.

692
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:13,314
911之后，我叔叔给我们队送了一堆
After 9/11, my uncle sent
a bunch out for the platoon,

693
01:02:13,473 --> 01:02:16,454
不过这次行动后，我会把它给你
but, uh, after this go-round,
I'll give it to you.

694
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:18,453
不，不，我不会拿你的家族饰品
No, no, I'm not gonna
take your family crest.

695
01:02:18,578 --> 01:02:21,115
好吧，其实我也不想给你
All right, good.
I didn't want to give it to you anyway.

696
01:02:21,281 --> 01:02:23,124
除此之外，我很确定我看见
Besides, man,
I'm pretty sure I saw you

697
01:02:23,283 --> 01:02:25,194
几天前你把什么东西放到了你的口袋里
putting something in your
cargo pocket the other day.

698
01:02:25,352 --> 01:02:28,993
- 那是什么？
- 我知道我见过你那个
- What's that?
- I know I've seen you carrying

699
01:02:29,156 --> 01:02:30,863
口袋里装了什么东西
something in that pocket right there.

700
01:02:32,392 --> 01:02:33,496
是什么？
What is it?

701
01:02:34,795 --> 01:02:35,967
这是我祖父的旗子
That's my grandfather's flag.

702
01:02:36,129 --> 01:02:37,699
- 真棒
- 我爸爸把他给了我
- Nice.
- My pop gave it to me,

703
01:02:37,864 --> 01:02:39,502
哪天我会把它给我的孩子
and now I'm gonna
give it to my boy someday.

704
01:02:39,666 --> 01:02:41,668
棒极了，我喜欢
All right. I like that.

705
01:02:51,578 --> 01:02:53,148
你在一艘很漂亮的船上
You're sitting on a wonderful boat.

706
01:02:53,313 --> 01:02:54,451
- 它很豪华
- 没错，谢谢
- It's fabulous.
- Thank you. Yes.

707
01:02:54,648 --> 01:02:56,924
- 我觉得它叫“星际飞船”
- “星际飞船”
- I believe it's called Starship.
- "Starship,"

708
01:02:57,084 --> 01:02:58,427
我喜欢你说“星际飞船”的方式
I love the way you say Starship.

709
01:02:58,585 --> 01:03:01,088
听上去像俄语，像一个《星际迷航》里的人
It's like Russian.
That guy, uh... Star Trek.

710
01:03:01,254 --> 01:03:03,359
叫什么来着，斯科蒂？哦，不，对不起，斯科特
What's his name, Scotty?
Oh, no, he was, sorry, Scott.

711
01:03:03,523 --> 01:03:05,867
- 我不知道
- 你从没看过《星际迷航》？
- I wouldn't Know.
- Yes. You've never seen Star Trek?

712
01:03:06,026 --> 01:03:07,699
- 没
- 你“疯”了
- No.
- Oh, that's insane.

713
01:03:07,861 --> 01:03:09,340
- 问题是这样的，伙计
- 嗯？
- So here's the problem, pal.
- Mm-hm?

714
01:03:09,496 --> 01:03:11,533
你身价很高
You're worth a lot of money.

715
01:03:11,698 --> 01:03:14,872
- 或者说你曾经身价很高
- 我相信我现在也是
- Or you were worth a lot of money.
- I believe I still am.

716
01:03:15,035 --> 01:03:16,173
- 是么？
- 没错
- You do?
- Yes.

717
01:03:16,336 --> 01:03:20,045
好吧，让我告诉你这个世界是怎么运转的吧，克里斯科
All right. Let me tell you
how the world works there, Crisco.

718
01:03:20,207 --> 01:03:21,743
- 是克里斯多
- 什么？
- It's Christo.
- Sorry?

719
01:03:21,908 --> 01:03:23,546
- 克里斯多
- 哦，当然了，抱歉
- Christo.
- Oh, of course. Sorry.

720
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:24,950
没事
It's OK.

721
01:03:25,112 --> 01:03:26,523
让我来告诉你这世界是怎么运转的
Let me tell you
how the world really works.

722
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,886
- 请吧
- 这不再是你的船了
- Please.
- This is no longer your boat.

723
01:03:28,048 --> 01:03:31,188
从我穿过那扇门之后，你再也不是原来的你了
Since I walked through that door,
you're not the same guy you used to be.

724
01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:34,560
就是这样的，我也没法阻止
You're just not.
There's nothing I can do to stop that,

725
01:03:34,721 --> 01:03:37,702
我帮不了你，除非你让我帮你
nothing I can do to help you right now,
unless you let me help you.

726
01:03:37,858 --> 01:03:41,396
我们需要共渡难关，兄弟，你和我
We need to do this together, pal.
You and me.

727
01:03:41,561 --> 01:03:45,270
跟伊斯兰圣战分子共事感觉如何？
So how is it that you're working
with these jihadi folks, then?

728
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:48,034
你是犹太人，对么？
You're Jewish, right?

729
01:03:50,103 --> 01:03:52,208
谢布尔是什么？
Shabal is what?

730
01:03:54,574 --> 01:03:57,418
- 你有没有跟你一起长大的朋友？
- 什么？
- You got a friend, like, you grew up with?
- Sorry?

731
01:03:57,577 --> 01:03:59,454
你有跟你一起长大的朋友吗？
Have you ever had a friend
that you grew up with?

732
01:03:59,613 --> 01:04:01,820
- 是的
- 有共同的兴趣，都踢足球
- Yes.
- Had, like, played interests, played soccer,

733
01:04:01,982 --> 01:04:03,825
或是...你们玩的什么，可能是棒球，对吧？
or... What would you play?
Baseball, probably, right?

734
01:04:03,984 --> 01:04:05,486
- 可能吧
- 是的
- Probably. Yeah.
- Yeah.

735
01:04:05,652 --> 01:04:06,995
后来大家各奔前程
And then you went
on your separate ways,

736
01:04:07,154 --> 01:04:09,964
数年后再遇见时
and then some years later,
you meet up.

737
01:04:10,123 --> 01:04:13,536
你完全认不出他来了
And you totally
didn't recognize the person.

738
01:04:13,727 --> 01:04:15,729
这就是我和谢布尔的故事
And that's what happened with Shabal.

739
01:04:15,896 --> 01:04:18,502
我们有共同的爱好
We share a common interest.

740
01:04:18,665 --> 01:04:22,909
因为宗教信仰，他突然有了不可思议的想法
So he came up with this incredible idea
because of his beliefs.

741
01:04:23,069 --> 01:04:27,347
我不必跟他有一样的信仰，但他是个聪明人
I don't necessarily share his beliefs,
but he's a smart guy.

742
01:04:27,507 --> 01:04:29,509
知道吗，就好像...
You know, it's almost like...

743
01:04:29,676 --> 01:04:31,280
就好像...
...you know, it's almost like...

744
01:04:31,444 --> 01:04:32,582
这就是我
...like this is me.

745
01:04:38,418 --> 01:04:41,024
- 这就是谢布尔
- 是吗？
- And that's Shabal.
- Is it?

746
01:04:41,188 --> 01:04:43,168
- 中间是美国人
- 是么？
- And America is in-between.
- Is it?

747
01:04:43,323 --> 01:04:44,358
没错
Yeah.

748
01:04:45,926 --> 01:04:47,166
很酷的理论吧？
Cool concept, no?

749
01:04:47,327 --> 01:04:48,829
- 在这里？
- 是的
- Right here?
- Yes.

750
01:04:50,297 --> 01:04:52,334
你认为这是游戏?
You think this is some kind of game?

751
01:04:54,835 --> 01:04:56,815
- 是吗？你觉得这很好笑么？
- 不，不
- Do you? Do you find this amusing?
- No. No.

752
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:58,950
- 我没觉得
- 你知道自己在这做什么吗？
- I'm not finding...
- Do you realize what you're doing here?

753
01:04:59,739 --> 01:05:02,151
基地呼叫黑胡小队
MAN OVER RADIO.' Blackbeard Actual,
this is Blackbeard Main.

754
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:04,653
目标B已清除
Post nation counterpart.
Secured target Bravo.

755
01:05:04,811 --> 01:05:07,917
通告全队，可以安全前往目标A
Report to Tri-Hull.
You're clear to move on target Alpha.

756
01:05:08,114 --> 01:05:10,788
收到基地，朝目标行进中
MAN 2 OVER RADIO: Roger, Main.
Clear to target.

757
01:05:14,087 --> 01:05:17,364
我只会向我的家人坦白
The only people
I answer to is my family.

758
01:05:17,524 --> 01:05:19,800
向我的妻子和我的孩子
To my wife and to my child.

759
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,031
除此之外，别无他人
And nobody else.

760
01:05:22,195 --> 01:05:25,335
- 你赶时间么？
- 不想再听你说废话了
- Running late somewhere?
- Shit filter's full.

761
01:05:25,498 --> 01:05:26,670
- 真的？
- 是的
- Really?
- Yeah.

762
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:30,246
问题是这样的，兄弟
So here's the problem, pal.

763
01:05:30,403 --> 01:05:32,246
你爱你的家人，对吧？
You do love your family, don't you?

764
01:05:33,406 --> 01:05:35,511
- 是的
- 那你的女儿呢？
- Yes, I do.
- And what about your daughter?

765
01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:37,086
我的女儿？
What about my daughter?

766
01:05:37,244 --> 01:05:39,087
你还想再看到她么？
Are you looking forward
to seeing her again?

767
01:05:39,246 --> 01:05:40,919
无时无刻都想见
Every minute of my life.

768
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:08,185
我让你看这个是想让你好好考虑下
I wanted you to see that so that you'd
think about some things very seriously,

769
01:06:08,341 --> 01:06:10,878
因为你会被关进某个“笼子”
because you're gonna be
sitting in a box somewhere.

770
01:06:11,044 --> 01:06:14,856
你会得到妥善和人道的待遇
You'll be treated properly
and humanely.

771
01:06:16,516 --> 01:06:20,794
这个女孩将会长大，结婚
That girl is gonna grow up,
and she's gonna get married,

772
01:06:20,954 --> 01:06:24,197
你老婆也会再嫁他人
and your wife is gonna find someone else,

773
01:06:24,357 --> 01:06:27,270
你会错过一切的
and you're gonna miss everything.

774
01:06:34,467 --> 01:06:37,914
如果我做了什么让家人置身危险的事
If I had done something
that would endanger my family,

775
01:06:38,071 --> 01:06:40,210
我会跟你现在有同样的想法
I would feel just
like you do right now.

776
01:06:43,076 --> 01:06:44,987
你能保证不碰我家人吗？
You promise not
to touch my family?

777
01:06:45,145 --> 01:06:47,056
我绝不会碰你家人
I would never touch your family.

778
01:06:48,381 --> 01:06:49,451
我不会
I would not.

779
01:06:56,656 --> 01:06:57,999
你对
Are you familiar with...

780
01:07:00,393 --> 01:07:01,929
陶瓷球熟悉么？
...ceramic ball bearings?

781
01:07:02,095 --> 01:07:03,472
不
No.

782
01:07:04,631 --> 01:07:06,838
想象一下，16件
Just imagine 16 suicide vests

783
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,071
装有陶瓷球的自爆背心
filled with those
ceramic ball bearings,

784
01:07:09,235 --> 01:07:13,741
通过金属探测仪和美国所有检查站
slipping by every metal detector
and every checkpoint in your country.

785
01:07:15,308 --> 01:07:17,754
现在能想象到经济崩溃了吗？
You think your economy
is fucked now?

786
01:07:19,179 --> 01:07:23,093
想象下媒体会怎么应对这事
Just think what the media
is gonna do with this. Hm?

787
01:07:23,249 --> 01:07:26,560
这会使911事件变得微不足道
It's gonna make 9/11 look like
a fucking walk in the park.

788
01:07:26,753 --> 01:07:28,664
就像在中央公园里散步一样
The grand Central Park.

789
01:07:29,956 --> 01:07:31,697
你这是在告诉我
So you're telling me...

790
01:07:32,859 --> 01:07:38,866
会有16个圣战分子穿着自爆背心
...there's 16 jihadis
wearing suicide vests.

791
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:42,442
大摇大摆穿越边境
They're gonna walk
right across the border.

792
01:07:43,536 --> 01:07:45,072
那他们的目的地是哪里？
So where are they going?

793
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,719
圣地亚哥, 旧金山,休斯顿
San Diego, San Francisco, Houston...

794
01:07:49,876 --> 01:07:51,617
随你选，到处都有
You pick a city, they'll be there.

795
01:07:51,778 --> 01:07:56,022
- 这就是现在的事态么？
- 我们说话时它就在发生着
- And this is happening now?
- It's happening as we speak.

796
01:07:56,983 --> 01:07:58,291
什么？
Sorry, what?

797
01:07:59,352 --> 01:08:01,855
现在它就在发生着，就在我们说话的时候
It's happening as we speak.

798
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:06,167
你怎么才能阻止？
(SIGHS) How can you stop this?

799
01:08:08,628 --> 01:08:10,198
我不能
I can't.

800
01:08:11,865 --> 01:08:16,075
塞德罗斯岛，墨西哥

801
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:03,583
黑胡，后援队已就位
Blackbeard Lead,
containment element is set.

802
01:10:03,743 --> 01:10:04,915
明白
Roger.

803
01:11:39,706 --> 01:11:42,277
卡洛斯, 门口有人！
救命！救命！

804
01:11:44,277 --> 01:11:45,915

01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:51,061
- 走
- 我们走！
- Go.
- Coming out!

807
01:11:55,288 --> 01:11:59,065
鼠帮，我是黑胡，我们在中心地带，即教堂南部与敌军交火
Rat Pack, this is Blackbeard. We're in
contact, midtown, south of the church.

808
01:12:08,635 --> 01:12:10,546

黑胡，你的方位是什么？
Blackbeard Lead, what's your pos?

812
01:12:39,132 --> 01:12:41,112
掩护我, 你可自由射击
RORKE OVER RADIO: Overwatch.
You're clear to engage.

813
01:12:42,268 --> 01:12:43,303
开火！
Go in hot.

814
01:13:05,091 --> 01:13:06,627
小心手雷！
Frag out!

815
01:13:15,968 --> 01:13:19,142
怀明，我看到两个目标正开车向南逃窜
Weimy, I've got two squilters
heading south in a pickup truck.

816
01:13:23,876 --> 01:13:24,877
我看见了
I see 'em.

817
01:13:29,282 --> 01:13:31,023
狠狠揍卡车里那两个家伙
Hit those two guys in the truck.

818
01:13:52,205 --> 01:13:53,343
火箭弹！
Rocket!

819
01:14:01,414 --> 01:14:02,688
小心手雷！
Frag out!

820
01:15:02,742 --> 01:15:04,744
长官？长官？
Sir? Sir?

821
01:15:04,911 --> 01:15:07,619
上尉？你没事吧？
LT? You all right?

822
01:15:13,686 --> 01:15:14,687
妈的
Damn.

823
01:15:14,887 --> 01:15:16,662
这玩意救了你一命，是吧？
You check that box, huh?

824
01:15:16,823 --> 01:15:18,131
嗯
Yeah.

825
01:15:19,992 --> 01:15:21,630
幸运的是那是颗哑弹，本来我应该受伤的
Good thing that was a dud.
I might've gotten hurt.

826
01:15:21,794 --> 01:15:24,934
- 是啊
- 哇哦
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

827
01:15:27,233 --> 01:15:28,576
天啊
Jesus.

828
01:15:31,938 --> 01:15:35,147
这可不是伊拉克手工作坊那种劣质自爆背心
This is not some bush-league
vest from an Iraqi hut.

829
01:15:35,308 --> 01:15:36,651
它装着高速弹丸
This is some high-speed shit.

830
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:40,522
我们或许该把它放到别的地方，是吧？
Maybe we should put this
somewhere else, huh?

831
01:15:48,488 --> 01:15:50,661
桑尼, 把这放到别的地方，好吗？
Hey, Sonny, find somewhere
to put this, would you?

832
01:15:57,463 --> 01:16:00,273
目标安全! 设置警戒区！
Target secure.
Set security.

833
01:16:00,433 --> 01:16:02,845
一个去北面，3个去南面
One's to the north, three south.

834
01:16:12,011 --> 01:16:15,549
这是你们的目标

835
01:16:47,947 --> 01:16:49,358
嘿，上士，目标搞定了
Hey, Chief, target's buttoned up.

836
01:16:49,515 --> 01:16:51,517
- 一切都安全了
- 谢谢，兄弟
- Everything's secure.
- Thanks, man.

837
01:16:51,684 --> 01:16:54,665
黑胡，任务并未完成，请待命
WOMAN OVER RADIO.' Actual, mission
not complete. Stand by for follow-on.

838
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,663
你只解决了一半的恐怖分子
You only got half that jihadist cell.

839
01:16:56,822 --> 01:16:59,996
- 目标安全，长官
- 行动还没结束
- The target's secure, sir.
- This fight isn't over yet.

840
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:03,003
听着，另一半的恐怖分子在7点时
Now, listen, the other half of that cell
is gonna be crossing the border

841
01:17:03,162 --> 01:17:06,473
会从墨西卡利利用地下通道穿过国界
（墨西哥下加利福尼亚州的首府）
using a tunnel network
from Mexicali at 0700.

842
01:17:06,632 --> 01:17:09,203
正和州政府协调中，不过直升机会先把你们送到城市外围
We're coordinating with State,
but for now the birds will drop you off

843
01:17:09,368 --> 01:17:12,645
接头人是指挥官佩卓斯
outside the city where your POC
is a Commander Pedros.

844
01:17:12,805 --> 01:17:14,580
路上我会给你更多的细节
I 'll give you more details en route.

845
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,879
- 黑胡，收到没？
- 收到，基地
- Actual, how do you copy?
- Roger, Main.

846
01:17:17,043 --> 01:17:19,045
好的，甲板上有接送我们的直升机
OK, we've got a helo
landing on the deck,

847
01:17:19,211 --> 01:17:21,350
我们将跟墨西哥特种部队及其指挥官碰面
we're gonna meet a Mexican
SOF commander and his team.

848
01:17:21,514 --> 01:17:24,358
他们会帮我们渗透目标并参与突击
They're gonna help infil us to
the target and join us on the assault.

849
01:17:25,585 --> 01:17:27,724
- 你究竟在说什么？
- 我们还没有完全消灭他们，上士
- What the hell are you talking about?
- We haven't got all of 'em yet, Chief.

850
01:17:27,887 --> 01:17:30,959
- 剩下的在哪儿？
- 他们在墨西卡利边境上
- And where's the rest of 'em?
- They're in Mexicali on the border.

851
01:17:31,123 --> 01:17:32,761
好的，那剩下的人
All right.
And the rest of the boys,

852
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:34,063
怎么回船上去？
how are they getting
back to the ship?

853
01:17:34,226 --> 01:17:35,534
好人理查号会继续待命
Bon Homme Richard
stayed on station.

854
01:17:35,695 --> 01:17:37,606
他们会派出一支陆战小队去帮助清理战场
They're gonna send in a Marine
element to help exploit the target.

855
01:17:37,763 --> 01:17:40,039
完事后剩下的人会跟他们一起走
When they're done, the boys
will pull off with them.

856
01:17:40,199 --> 01:17:43,112
好的.我在想让一小队和我去执行任务
OK. I'm thinking Squad One
and myself roll out.

857
01:17:43,269 --> 01:17:44,976
很好，二小队在这里驻守
Perfect. Squad Two
stays here, buttons it up,

858
01:17:45,137 --> 01:17:46,912
- 和陆战队一起撤退
- 没问题
- pulls out with the Marines.
- OK.

859
01:17:53,312 --> 01:17:55,121
在日出之前我们
We're moving north
of here through town,

860
01:17:55,281 --> 01:17:56,851
从这里向北穿过镇子
and crossing at sunrise.

861
01:17:57,016 --> 01:17:59,792
另一组会在几天内到达德克萨斯
The other group will get
into Texas the following day,

862
01:17:59,952 --> 01:18:01,397
通过华瑞兹市（墨西哥）
through Juarez.

863
01:18:02,655 --> 01:18:04,157
明白吗？
Comprendes ?

864
01:18:16,068 --> 01:18:20,016
嘿，长官,！到底谁下令派我们去墨西卡利的？
Hey, sir! Who the hell cleared us hot
to go to Mexicali anyway?

865
01:18:20,172 --> 01:18:22,379
是高层的命令
This one's going all
the way up the flagpole.

866
01:18:22,541 --> 01:18:24,179
国务院决定的
State Department's on it.

867
01:18:34,353 --> 01:18:37,000
美墨边界

868
01:19:03,182 --> 01:19:05,753
嘿，长官，2号频道
Hey, sir. Channel two.

869
01:19:10,823 --> 01:19:12,564
嘿，如果任务还是没完没了
Hey, this tempo keeps up like this,

870
01:19:12,725 --> 01:19:15,296
那杰姬得自己想法生孩子了
Jackie's gonna be squeezing
that kid out on her own.

871
01:19:16,362 --> 01:19:18,501
不过如果我们迅速完成任务
However, we hit this target quick enough,

872
01:19:18,631 --> 01:19:20,872
你就能骑驴回家了
you jump on a burro
and ride that shit home.

873
01:19:21,033 --> 01:19:24,537
我可不需要一只驴子
Hey, I ain't gonna need no burro.

874
01:19:26,072 --> 01:19:27,415
你拿到2周假期了？
Did you get your two weeks?

875
01:19:27,573 --> 01:19:29,849
卫星电话不是白打的
All that time I was
spending on the sat phone,

876
01:19:30,009 --> 01:19:32,285
我不是求上面让我回家
it wasn't to convince them
to let me go home,

877
01:19:32,445 --> 01:19:34,550
而是求他们让你负责任务
it was to convince them
to leave your ass in charge.

878
01:19:56,068 --> 01:19:59,500
美墨边界

879
01:20:42,281 --> 01:20:44,420
- 长官
- 上尉
- Sir.
- Lieutenant.

880
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:46,722
看起来政府为了促成这事做了很大努力，是吧?
Seems our governments have been
very busy to make this possible, huh?

881
01:20:46,886 --> 01:20:48,297
我听说是最高层决定的
All the way to the top,
from what I hear.

882
01:20:48,454 --> 01:20:50,331
有些事情你必须明白
There is something
that you have to understand.

883
01:20:50,489 --> 01:20:54,301
我的上司很害怕事情演变成墨西哥版的“黑鹰坠落”
（请参见电影《黑鹰坠落》）
My superiors, they're very
fearful of a Mexican Mogadishu.

884
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:56,531
他们一直强调不能引发政治灾难
No Black Hawk Down
is what they're saying,

885
01:20:56,729 --> 01:20:58,299
所以我们要小心行事
so we do need
to stay under the radar.

886
01:20:58,464 --> 01:21:00,444
- 完全明白，长官
- 好的
- I understand completely, sir.
- Good.

887
01:21:00,599 --> 01:21:03,443
我很感谢你们来帮忙，但是我们时间不多
Your team's presence here is greatly
appreciated, but we are out of time.

888
01:21:03,602 --> 01:21:05,104
- 得马上行动
- 告诉我地点，我们就出发
- We need to move.
- Tell me where, we go.

889
01:21:05,271 --> 01:21:06,306
帮我整合这些信息
Help piece this together for me.

890
01:21:06,472 --> 01:21:07,780
- 没问题
- 我们的情报显示
- OK.
- Our intel says

891
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:10,614
他们会使用地下通道，在“制奶厂”下面
they're using a tunnel network
that is under a milk factory.

892
01:21:10,776 --> 01:21:12,756
这对你来说意味什么？
This mean anything to you?

893
01:21:12,878 --> 01:21:15,324
我知道确切位置，离这里不远
I know exactly where that is.
It's not far from here.

894
01:21:15,481 --> 01:21:17,154
那就是我们的目的地
Then that's where we're going.

895
01:21:17,316 --> 01:21:19,125
这或许是整个墨西卡利
Of all of the places in Mexicali

896
01:21:19,285 --> 01:21:21,287
最糟糕的地方了
that you could have picked,
this is probably the worst.

897
01:21:21,453 --> 01:21:23,455
贩毒集团控制着这个地区的各个角落
The cartels control
that area from all angles.

898
01:21:23,622 --> 01:21:25,295
他们火力强大
They have us heavily outgunned.

899
01:21:25,457 --> 01:21:27,664
单是接近目标就很艰难
Simply reaching your target
is gonna be very difficult.

900
01:21:27,827 --> 01:21:30,398
长官，有8个“外国公民”正要进入我们国家
Sir, we have eight foreign nationals
heading to our country.

901
01:21:30,563 --> 01:21:32,941
无需多说，他们肯定不喜欢美国人
Needless to say,
they are no big fan of ours.

902
01:21:33,098 --> 01:21:35,271
如果他们在那里，那就是我们的目的地
If they are at that factory,
that's where we're going.

903
01:21:35,401 --> 01:21:37,574
上尉，我会带你去任何你要去的地方
Lieutenant, I'll take you
anywhere you need to go,

904
01:21:37,736 --> 01:21:40,740
但是，让你的部下准备进行比想象中还激烈的战斗吧
but prepare your men for a bigger fight
than what you had imagined.

905
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:44,114
你不仅仅是和8个人作战，更是和他们背后的贩毒集团作战
You're not fighting eight men. You're also
fighting the cartel that's protecting them.

906
01:21:44,276 --> 01:21:46,517
如果目标进入了地下通道
If your targets make it
into those tunnels,

907
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:48,681
那他们会像幽灵一样消失
they'll disappear like ghosts.

908
01:23:31,083 --> 01:23:32,824
你从这里进入通道
You enter the tunnels right here.

909
01:23:32,985 --> 01:23:35,124
你需要步行七英里到达交叉口
You will walk
seven miles to this fork.

910
01:23:35,287 --> 01:23:36,857
我的人会告诉你该去哪个隧道
My men will tell you
what tunnel to take.

911
01:23:37,056 --> 01:23:41,562
当你到了那里，我的任务就完成了
Once you get to this point,
my job is done.

912
01:23:41,694 --> 01:23:43,503
到时候就靠自己了
You're on your own.

913
01:24:12,157 --> 01:24:14,933
- 上尉，我们要进去了！
- 明白
- Lieutenant, we're going now!
- Roger that.

914
01:24:36,648 --> 01:24:40,619
上士, 不要停下，我们要冲进去
Chief, we're not stopping.
We're rolling up on target, hard.

915
01:24:40,786 --> 01:24:43,392
明白，长官，30秒准备
Roger that, sir.
We're about 30 seconds out.

916
01:24:57,870 --> 01:25:00,874
距南边入口一分钟
RORKE OVER RADIO: One mike out
from the south entrance.

917
01:25:35,808 --> 01:25:37,515
老大！在房顶上！
Jefe! On the roof!

918
01:25:49,188 --> 01:25:51,134
我们得走了，快！
We gotta go. Now.

919
01:26:08,974 --> 01:26:10,146
我们走

920
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,603
你待在这里

921
01:26:23,422 --> 01:26:26,301
长官！留两个人在这！
Sir! Leave two men here!

922
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,159
准备好，他们来了！

923
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:56,021
怀明！
Weimy!

924
01:26:59,858 --> 01:27:00,859
怀明！
Weimy!

925
01:27:02,094 --> 01:27:03,198
我要你把这些混蛋搞定！
I need you
to lock this shit down!

926
01:27:12,004 --> 01:27:13,278
小心手雷！
Frag out!

927
01:27:15,774 --> 01:27:16,980
跟着我
On me.

928
01:27:42,801 --> 01:27:44,747
你们去那边的门！
You guys got the gate!

929
01:27:44,903 --> 01:27:47,474
卡尔！你去前门！
Call! You're going to the front door!

930
01:27:50,042 --> 01:27:51,578
上!
Go!

931
01:28:18,904 --> 01:28:20,212
卡尔！
Call!

932
01:28:50,709 --> 01:28:52,493
你就在这里为“真主牺牲”吧

933
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:56,200
怎么了？

934
01:28:56,451 --> 01:28:59,300
你会在天国与你丈夫团聚的

935
01:29:10,989 --> 01:29:12,229
更换弹药！
Changing!

936
01:29:57,936 --> 01:30:00,439
炸弹！
Bomb!

937
01:30:27,499 --> 01:30:29,479
我们干嘛停下？

938
01:30:52,991 --> 01:30:54,095
该死的，长官
Damn it, sir.

939
01:30:54,259 --> 01:30:55,602
我要怎么跟家里人解释啊？
How you gonna explain
that one to my family?

940
01:30:55,761 --> 01:30:58,105
退回去就不用解释这事了，是吧？
Get back there
so I don't have to, huh?

941
01:31:14,413 --> 01:31:15,687
安全！
Clear!

942
01:31:38,236 --> 01:31:40,477
小心手雷！
Grenade!

943
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:41,033
上尉！
LT!

944
01:32:44,703 --> 01:32:46,011
上士，我来帮他
Chief, I got him.

945
01:33:08,994 --> 01:33:10,667
继续行动，我来掩护你
Keep going. I'll cover you.

946
01:33:10,829 --> 01:33:11,830
快进隧道

947
01:34:58,003 --> 01:34:59,243
上士
Chief.

948
01:35:03,808 --> 01:35:06,652
上士！
Chief!

949
01:35:09,247 --> 01:35:11,420
突击2队，我是突击1队
SONNY (ECHOING): Assault Two,
this is Assault One.

950
01:35:11,583 --> 01:35:15,725
注意，地下通道已安全，所有目标已击毙
Be advised, tunnel is secure
and all threats are neutralized.

951
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,093
上尉和上士倒下了
LT and Chief are down.

952
01:35:18,256 --> 01:35:21,260
重复一遍, 上尉和上士倒下了
OVER RADIO: I say again,
LT and Chief are down,

953
01:36:17,816 --> 01:36:19,693
你父亲是个好男人
DA VE.' Your father was a good man.

954
01:36:19,851 --> 01:36:22,263
幼年丧父会让你感到艰辛
Growing up without him
is gonna be hard.

955
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:24,422
感到痛苦
It's gonna hurt.

956
01:36:24,589 --> 01:36:28,560
感到孤独，感觉迷失了“海岸线”
You'll feel alone, out to sea,
with no shore in sight.

957
01:36:28,727 --> 01:36:32,732
你会纳闷“为什么是我？我什么是我的父亲？”
You'll wooden
"Why me? Why him?"

958
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:48,790
但请记住，你血管里流淌着勇士的鲜血
Remember, you have
warrior's blood in your veins.

959
01:36:48,947 --> 01:36:51,894
造就你父亲的“准则”
The code that made your father
who he was is the same code

960
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:55,793
也将同样使你变成他所尊敬的男子汉
that'll make you a man
he would admire, respect.

961
01:36:57,255 --> 01:37:00,600
把你的悲伤放进“盒子”里，锁起来
Put your pain in a box.
Lock it down.

962
01:37:00,759 --> 01:37:03,797
正如你父亲所钟爱的绘画里的人物
Like those people in the
paintings your father liked,

963
01:37:03,962 --> 01:37:08,536
我们也是由各要素“组成”的
we are men made up of boxes,
chambers of loss and triumph,

964
01:37:08,666 --> 01:37:12,045
损失、胜利、伤痛、希望和爱
of hurt and hope and love.

965
01:37:13,138 --> 01:37:15,778
- 没有人比能够驾驭情绪和
- 准备！
- No one is stronger or more dangerous...
- Ready!

966
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:17,647
- 面对过去的人更坚强
- 瞄准！
- ...Than a man who can harness emotions.
- Aim!

967
01:37:17,809 --> 01:37:20,221
- 或更强大
- His past.

968
01:37:21,579 --> 01:37:24,253
- 瞄准！
- Aim!

969
01:37:25,583 --> 01:37:27,824
- 瞄准！

01:42:43,301 --> 01:42:46,578
J' AH I saw was smoke and fire

1009
01:42:46,737 --> 01:42:49,513
J' I didn't feel a thing

1010
01:42:51,242 --> 01:42:54,553
J' But suddenly I was rising higher

1011
01:42:54,679 --> 01:42:57,819
J' And I felt like I just made

1012
01:42:57,982 --> 01:43:01,725
J' The biggest mistake

1013
01:43:01,853 --> 01:43:06,063
J' When I thought
about my unborn child

1014
01:43:06,224 --> 01:43:09,034
J' And when I thought about my wife

1015
01:43:09,227 --> 01:43:11,969
J' And the answer rang out clear

1016
01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:14,508
J' From somewhere up above

1017
01:43:14,665 --> 01:43:17,145
J' No greater gift has man

1018
01:43:17,301 --> 01:43:21,579
J' Than to la y down his life for love

1019
01:43:23,908 --> 01:43:25,581
J' And I wonder

1020
01:43:25,743 --> 01:43:28,189
J' Would I give my life?

1021
01:43:30,648 --> 01:43:34,186
J' Could I make that sacrifice?

1022
01:43:36,354 --> 01:43:38,925
J' If it came down to it
Couldl take the bullet?

1023
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:44,199
J' I would
Yes, I would

1024
01:43:44,362 --> 01:43:45,932
J' For you

1025
01:43:49,834 --> 01:43:52,041
J' Mm-hm

1026
01:43:56,774 --> 01:43:59,345
J' Maybe you don't understand

1027
01:43:59,510 --> 01:44:03,788
J' I don't understand it all myself

1028
01:44:03,948 --> 01:44:07,828
J' But there's a brother on my
left and another on my right

1029
01:44:07,985 --> 01:44:11,626
J' And in his pocket
just like mine

1030
01:44:11,789 --> 01:44:15,236
J' He's got a photograph

1031
01:44:15,393 --> 01:44:18,465
J' And they're waiting
for him back home

1032
01:44:18,629 --> 01:44:20,905
J' And it's weighing on my mind

1033
01:44:21,065 --> 01:44:24,012
J' I'm not trying to be a hero

1034
01:44:24,168 --> 01:44:26,808
J' I don't wanna die

1035
01:44:26,971 --> 01:44:29,474
J' But right now in this moment

1036
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:32,086
J' You don't think twice

1037
01:44:33,578 --> 01:44:37,355
J' I wonder
Would I give my life?

1038
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:43,061
J' Could I make that sacrifice?

1039
01:44:45,223 --> 01:44:47,999
J' If it came down to it
Couldl take the bullet?

1040
01:44:48,159 --> 01:44:53,268
J' I would
Yes, I would

1041
01:44:54,932 --> 01:44:57,674
J' You don't think about right

1042
01:44:57,802 --> 01:45:00,442
J' You don't think about wrong

1043
01:45:00,605 --> 01:45:03,245
J' You just do what you gotta do

1044
01:45:03,407 --> 01:45:06,047
J' To defend your own

1045
01:45:06,210 --> 01:45:09,748
J' And I'd do the same

1046
01:45:09,914 --> 01:45:13,521
J' For you

1047
01:45:22,093 --> 01:45:24,198
